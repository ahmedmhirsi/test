# Deployment Guide

Your project is ready for deployment. Here are 3 simple steps:

## Step 1: Go to Render.com
Open your browser and go to: **https://dashboard.render.com/select-repo?type=blueprint**

## Step 2: Connect GitHub
1. Click **"Connect GitHub"**.
2. Select your repository: **PI_DEV_AssistanceIntelligente**
3. Select branch: **Marketing**
4. Click **"Apply"** — Render will read the `render.yaml` file and configure everything automatically.

## Step 3: Wait & Get Your URL
1. Render will build and deploy your app (takes ~3-5 minutes).
2. Once done, you'll get a URL like: `https://smartnexus-marketing.onrender.com`
3. Open that URL to verify your site is live!

## Step 4: Connect Your Domain (Optional)
1. In Render dashboard, go to your service → **Settings** → **Custom Domains**.
2. Add your domain name.
3. Follow the DNS instructions.

## Step 5: Verify AdSense
1. Go to `https://your-url.onrender.com/ads.txt` — verify it shows your Publisher ID.
2. Go to Google AdSense → **Sites** → **Add Site** → paste your URL.
3. Click **Verify**.
