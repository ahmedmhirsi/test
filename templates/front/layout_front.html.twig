{% extends 'front_office/base.html.twig' %}

{% block title %}Portail Réclamations - SmartNexus AI{% endblock %}

{# 
   The content block is strictly passed through to the parent.
   Child templates (index, new, show, edit) define their own 'content' block 
   which will naturally override the one in front_office/base.html.twig.
   
   If we needed a specific wrapper for *all* reclamation pages that isn't in base,
   we would do:
   {% block content %}
       <div class="reclamation-wrapper">
           {% block reclamation_content %}{% endblock %}
       </div>
   {% endblock %}
   But the child templates use 'block content' directly, so we just let them bubble up.
